# Welcome to AMT 2020



## Week 1

* **Objectives**

  * Be able to explain what a "layered" or "tiered" architecture is.
  * Be able to explain how Java EE is one of the platforms for building multi-tiered architectures.
  * Be able to explain what the MVC design pattern means in web development and why it is useful.
  * Be able to implement the MVC design pattern with selected Java EE APIs (Servlets, JSPs, JSTL) 
  * Be able to explain what Docker Compose is and how it complements Docker

* **Project**

  * Get started with the ~~Stack Over~~(Flow) project
  * *Understand the constraints for project 1. We will not use Spring Boot. We will not implement a REST API. We will not use a Javascript framework such as Vue.js or React in the front-end. We will not immediately use JPA or another ORM. This will come later.*
  * Create mockups for your version of the application
  * Create Servlets and JSPs for
  * Investigate [CodeceptJS](https://codecept.io/) for automated user acceptance testing

* **The Question of the Week**: 

  * *Pour développer une application avec la Servlet API, il est nécessaire d'utiliser un serveur d'application Java EE (maintenant Jakarta EE). Donnez votre avis sur cette proposition et justifiez vos arguments.*

* **Repos**

  * Here is the repo for the first Java EE demo: https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-Discovery

* **Notes about the YouTube Playlist:**

  * I have added 4 videos (Bootcamp 1.1 - 1.4) with explanations and demonstrations about Java EE (what is an application server? how do I deploy a .war file into an application server?). I have also added 5 videos (Bootcamp 2.1 - 2.6). *You are not supposed to follow the instructions step-by-step*, because the videos have been produced when I was still using Netbeans. However, because the core of the Servlet API is stable, the concepts and code that you see in the videos are still valid.
