# Welcome to AMT 2020



## Week 2

* **Objectives**

  * Be able to explain what it means for a component to be "managed" and by "what" components are managed.
  * Be able to explain what dependency injection means in object-oriented programming.
  * Be able to explain how dependency injection can be implemented "from scratch". See https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-Dependency-Injection
  * Be able to explain how dependency injection is implemented in the Java EE / Jakarta EE platform.
  * Be able to explain what Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is.
  * Be able to explain the relationship between AOP, managed components and dependency injection.

* **Project**

  * Replace Payara / Wildfly with Open Liberty, a modern implementation of Jakarta EE (see [this webcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJI_9VArhtY&list=PLfKkysTy70QZe0fhUhZmR64ZPUIFpN4MJ&index=1&t=733s))
  * Study the reference architecture described in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr7OeHtefvQ&list=PLfKkysTy70QZe0fhUhZmR64ZPUIFpN4MJ&index=3) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW9YFmC_va0&list=PLfKkysTy70QZe0fhUhZmR64ZPUIFpN4MJ&index=4) webcast, which provides the overall structure for your application across all tiers.
  * Reuse the code you wrote during the first week.
  * Make sure that your CodeceptJS tests still work and extend them.
  * Implement a new feature (users can ask questions)
  * Implement a first continuous integration pipeline with GitHub Actions (build and publish a Docker image as described in [this webcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrTIZBMmqhI&list=PLfKkysTy70QZe0fhUhZmR64ZPUIFpN4MJ&index=2&t=8s)).

* **The Question of the Week**: 

  * *Expliquez comment les Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) permettent d'appliquer les principes de la programmation orientée aspects (AOP). Appuyez-vous sur un exemple de code et expliquez en détails ce qui se passe "derrière les décors" (i.e. expliquez ce que le serveur d'application fait).*

* **Notes about the YouTube Playlist:**

  * I have added 4 videos (see the links in the Project paragraph just above).
